My name is David Danzilio and I’m currently the Cloud and Platform Automation Practice Manager at [Kovarus](http://www.kovarus.com). This blog is my way of contributing back to the community. It’s also a sort of exposure therapy for my impostor syndrome. Maybe you’ll learn something. Better yet, maybe you’ll teach me something.

My areas of interest include Linux, Puppet, Test Driven Development (or BDD), Clojure, Go, and Ruby. I don’t have a CS background. I have a BA in Political Science and an MBA with concentrations in Management Information Systems and Public Affairs. I started out in academia, dabbled in healthcare (never, never again), did a stint in nuclear weapons research, and now I basically send email for a living.
